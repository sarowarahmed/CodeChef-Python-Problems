#Write a program which does the following

#Declare a variable num and store a user defined input from the console in it
#Declare a variable a and initialise it to 0
#Use the while syntax to create a loop, output the following to the console
#Print a in separate lines as long as it is less than num.
#Increment a by 1 in each iteration.

num = int(input())
a = 0

while a < num:
    print(a)
    a = a + 1
